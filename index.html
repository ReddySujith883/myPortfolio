                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm Sujith Kumar Reddy Kommareddy, a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience
                        in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable, high-performance web applications.
                        My expertise spans both backend and frontend technologies, utilizing Java (Spring Boot, Spring
                        MVC, Hibernate) and React.js.</p>
                    <p>I excel in building robust backend systems, including designing and consuming RESTful and GraphQL
                        APIs, and developing scalable microservices using Spring Boot. On the frontend, I am
                        proficient in JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and Material UI, focusing on
                        creating responsive user interfaces.</p>
                    <p>My cloud and DevOps skills include deploying and managing applications on AWS (EC2, Lambda, RDS,
                        S3, Elastic Beanstalk) and Azure (App Services, Functions, SQL Database).
                        I'm highly experienced with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform for CI/CD
                        pipelines and infrastructure automation. I also possess strong knowledge of relational
                        databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, and implement
                        caching solutions like Redis to optimize performance.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career at companies like Capital One Financial and Hexaware
                        Technologies, I have designed scalable backend microservices, led transitions to
                        serverless architectures, and built intuitive user interfaces that significantly improved engagement and
                        reduced load times. I have also developed real-time streaming data pipelines
                        with Apache Kafka, constructed automated deployment workflows with Docker, and implemented robust security
                        mechanisms including OAuth2 and JWT.
                        I am adept at working in Agile environments, leading sprint planning, code reviews, and driving
                        continuous improvement.</p>
