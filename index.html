        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <img src="gp.jpg" alt="Sujith Kumar Reddy Kommareddy Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">
        <p>I'm Sujith Kumar Reddy Kommareddy, a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience
            in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable, high-performance web applications.
            My expertise spans both backend and frontend technologies, utilizing Java (Spring Boot, Spring
            MVC, Hibernate) and React.js.</p>
        <p>I excel in building robust backend systems, including designing and consuming RESTful and GraphQL
            APIs, and developing scalable microservices using Spring Boot. On the frontend, I am
            proficient in JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and Material UI, focusing on
            creating responsive user interfaces.</p>
        <p>My cloud and DevOps skills include deploying and managing applications on AWS (EC2, Lambda, RDS,
            S3, Elastic Beanstalk) and Azure (App Services, Functions, SQL Database).
            I'm highly experienced with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform for CI/CD
            pipelines and infrastructure automation. I also possess strong knowledge of relational
            databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, and implement
            caching solutions like Redis to optimize performance.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career at companies like Capital One Financial and Hexaware
            Technologies , I have designed scalable backend microservices, led transitions to
            serverless architectures, and built intuitive user interfaces that significantly improved engagement and
            reduced load timesI have also developed real-time streaming data pipelines
            with Apache Kafka , constructed automated deployment workflows with Docker , and implemented robust security
            mechanisms including OAuth2 and JWT.
            I am adept at working in Agile environments, leading sprint planning, code reviews, and driving
            continuous improvement.</p>
